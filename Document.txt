I describe my project

- I have made 1 homepage and 1 portal page
- The home page is where customers can choose to buy products. 
  When customers click buy, 
  the quantity in the shopping cart will skyrocket.
- When the customer clicks buy, the cart will be empty
- In the shopping cart, customers can change the purchase quantity 
   and the system automatically calculates the total price


Portal page description
- http://localhost:3000/portal
- In the portal page, I have just developed the products section
- In the product section there are 2 parts: product management and order management
- Product management will be to add, edit, and delete products that will be displayed on the homepage
- In the order page there will be 2 tabs, new orders and delivered orders

- My project code is pure HTML and SCSS, I only use antd to use modal, form and table
- I created the layout myself and designed it according to a website I consulted online https://fptshop.com.vn/
- I haven't responded to it yet, I'll keep working on it
